/// Presentation Layer - UI and State Management
/// 
/// This folder contains all UI-related components and state management for the Products feature.
/// 
/// Structure:
/// - pages/: Screen/Page widgets (e.g., ProductScreen)
/// - bloc/: BLoC patterns for state management (to be added)
/// 
/// Note: This is organized following the clean architecture pattern where the
/// presentation layer depends on the domain layer through repository abstractions.
